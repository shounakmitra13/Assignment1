Customization
You can customize the various sections of the portfolio (like "About Me", "Experiences", etc.) by modifying the App.js file. In the gallery section, users can upload new images from their computer by clicking the "Add Image" button. You can preload different images in the images array or adjust the layout as per your needs.

Adding New Images
The application includes functionality to allow users to upload new images directly from their computer. This is implemented using the File API, where images are selected and then rendered dynamically in the gallery section. You can modify this feature in App.js to allow for additional functionality such as image editing, deleting, or resizing.

Known Issues
Question Mark Image & Design Placeholder: Due to the unavailability of the exact images from the original design, placeholders for the question mark (question.jpg) and design image (design.jpg) have been added. These placeholders serve as functional stand-ins but do not exactly match the intended visuals. It is recommended to replace these files with more accurate images as needed.
